  <h3>What did the Vikings Eat?</h3>
  <p>Mostly it is thought that Vikings ate what they could hunt, gather and make at their own farms. Food from the sea, rivers and lakes made up about 25% of the viking diet. Although they ate other meats fish was likely their main source of meat protein. They would smoke the meats to preserve it. Some farm items consisted of fruits, nuts. vegetables, goats, milk from cows, cheeses, barley, rye and oats to name a few. Evidence of bread was found at Viking Sites. Their only sweetener at the time was wild honey. Some theories are that the vikings ate meat, cheese between two slices of bread-yes a Sandwich!</p>
